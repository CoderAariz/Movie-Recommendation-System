# Movie-Recommendation-System
The Movie Recommendation System is a filtering system which recommends the movies to the user on the basis of movies they have watched in the past.
We have used the collaborative filtering technique to make recommendations for a user based on rating and preferences data of many users. The main idea behind this technique is that if two users have both watched certain common movies, then the movies that one user has watched that the other user has not yet tried can be recommended to him. We see collaborative filtering technique in action on various video streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. 
In our project we have used Apriori Algorithm for finding the association between the user preferences and then recommending a movie to a new user. 
We have used Jupyter Notebook IDE and pandas and numpy libraries for implementing our program.
